# Example Differential Analysis Workflow

Using the processed titration data, it is possible to determine how different receptors compare to one another with regard to binding to the Fc mutants. The example workflow here compares the FcγR2b and FcγR2a-131H receptors.

[FcgR2b_mutation_to_Ka.csv](https://github.com/Ortlund-Laboratory/DMS_IgG1Fc/blob/main/example_differential_analysis/FcgR2b_mutation_to_Ka.csv)<br>
This is the output from our FcgR2b titration analysis, renamed from **mutation_to_Ka.csv** to differentiate it from FcgR2a-131H.<br>
[FcgR2a-131H_mutation_to_Ka.csv](https://github.com/Ortlund-Laboratory/DMS_IgG1Fc/blob/main/example_differential_analysis/FcgR2a-131H_mutation_to_Ka.csv)<br>
This is the output from our FcgR2a-131H titration analysis, renamed from **mutation_to_Ka.csv** to differentiate it from FcgR2b.<br>

Amino acid sequence for WT Fc. This is required to complete the heatmap.
