# PacBio Library Sequencing

PacBio library sequencing is required to connect variants to their respective barcodes. The output is essential for enrichment/escape and titration analyses, and can be used repeatedly provided the analyses use the same library.

## Libraries Used

Lib01 is the primary library used for our analyses. We created Lib02 for cross-validation purposes.
