# PacBio Library Sequencing

PacBio library sequencing is required to connect variants to their respective barcodes. The output is essential for enrichment/escape and titration analyses, and can be used repeatedly provided the analyses use the same library.

## Libraries Used

Lib01 is the primary library used for our analyses. We created Lib02 for cross-validation purposes. 

Please refer to [Lib02](https://github.com/Ortlund-Laboratory/DMS_IgG1Fc/tree/main/PacBio_Library_Sequencing/Lib02) for the raw statistics for that library. Please refer to [Lib01](https://github.com/Ortlund-Laboratory/DMS_IgG1Fc/tree/main/PacBio_Library_Sequencing/Lib01) for the raw data for that library, plus a more detailed guide outlining the workflow.

Input fastq files are too large for GitHub, and can be found at the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA).<br>
