## Analysis Workflow
### Build Computing Environment
`conda` is required, and can be obtained _via_ the minimal installer, `miniconda` [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/).

Installation of mamba (another package manager) is then required since snakemake depends on it. Mamba sometimes will not install with default conda settings. A workaround is to change conda settings to 4.12:

`conda install conda=4.12`
