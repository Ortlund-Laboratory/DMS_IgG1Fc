## ΔlogKa vs distance analysis

Analyzing the effects of single-point mutations on the binding affinity (ΔlogKa) revealed two hotspots on Fc which were particularly prone to effecting ΔlogKa. These were, respectively, situated 20-30 Å from the receptor center of mass (CoM) (i.e., those residues directly at the interface with the receptor) and at 50-60 Å from the receptor CoM (i.e., a layer which encompasses the interface between the CH2 and CH3 regions on both chains A and B, and well as the interface between chains A and B).

DMS data involving all single-point mutations from residues within these regions were therefore extracted. Mutations which give an increased logKa to the inhibitory receptor (FcγR2b) whilst decreasing logKa to *all* of the activating receptors (FcγR2aH, FcγR2aR, FcγR3aF and FcγR3aV) were highlighted. Likewise, mutations which increase logKa to all activating receptors whilst decreasing logKa to the inhibitory receptor were highlighted. 

These data are shown in the spreadsheet. The tabs *Selected_Mutations_20_30* and *Selected_Mutations_50_60* give the collated data, along with the difference in ΔlogKa the mutation causes with respect to the inhibitory receptor minus the ΔlogKa the mutation causes with respect to the average of all of the activating receptors.
